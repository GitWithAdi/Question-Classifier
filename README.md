🧮 Question Classifier (NLP)
A Machine Learning project that automatically classifies math competition problems into topics (e.g., Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory) using Natural Language Processing.

📌 Project Overview
This project uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (Linear SVC) to predict the category of a math problem based on its text. The model is trained on the MATH Dataset and tracks performance metrics using Weights & Biases.
